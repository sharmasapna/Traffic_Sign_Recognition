## Summary

In today’s world, as the number of vehicles is increasing, so are the problems associated with them. One of the many problems is the high number of road mishaps that are caused resulting in fatal accidents. One of the main reasons for this is that people often don’t recognize or follow traffic sign boards set up by the government to ensure the safety of everyone around. So we have decided to make a traffic sign recognizer which can inform the driver of the vehicle about the traffic sign coming ahead and to follow it. This can substantially reduce the number of road accidents and save lives.

Traffic signs are an essential part of our day-to-day lives. They contain critical information that ensures the safety of all the people around us. There are several different types of traffic signs like speed limits, no entry, traffic signals, turn left or right, children crossing, no passing of heavy vehicles, etc. Traffic signs classification is the process of identifying which class a traffic sign belongs to. It has a very major role to play in self-driving cars, which is the future of the automobile industry.

## Data Description

The GTSRB dataset (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark) is provided by the Institut für Neuroinformatik group. It was published for a competition held in 2011. Images are spread across 43 different types of traffic signs and contain a total of 39,209 train examples and 12,630 test ones. The features available along with the images are as follows:

Width: Width of the image in pixels
Height: Height of the image in pixels
Roi.X1: Upper left X-coordinate of the bounding box.
Roi.Y1: Upper left Y-coordinate of the bounding box.
Roi.X2: Lower right X-coordinate of the bounding box.
Roi.Y2: Lower right Y-coordinate of the bounding box.
ClassId: Class label of the image. It is an Integer between 0 and 43.
Path: Path where the image is present in the Train folder. 
 
 
## Steps Followed 
1. Image cropped according to the dimensions given in the csv
2. Image resizing by cropping/ padding to size 64x64 and 30x30
3. Image color enhancing with histogram equalizer method
4. Image sharpening
5. Data augmentation 
6. CNN model with 4 convolutional layer and 2 dense layer
7. Model training 
8. Results



## Results

The classes are clearly not uniformly distributed, as can be seen in Figure 1. There are certain signs that appear more often than others. Less numbers of images can potentially undermine the training process.

Figure 1: Train data samples in each class


The images come in varied dimensions. Majority of the images fall between 32 to 64 pixels. We will have to tackle this by making the height and width constant for all images.
